<h2>Description</h2>
This Project shows steps taken to troubleshoot a device with DHCP issues and incorrect screen orientation; not connecting to the client internal server and screen was inverter from the admin domain by a super user. I couldnt manually orient the tab, i had to gain a temporary super user access to do that.. Not only so, but also shows power of collaboration and communication across different stakeholders, support level, proper troubleshooting steps as well as procurement of new device and returns.
